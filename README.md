User Stories

Day 1:

1. As a developer, I need my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.

2. As the creator, I need the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me, and I can build my audience.

3. As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.

4. As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive with a menu, so that I can get around using any device.

Day 2:

1. As a developer, I want my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.

2. As the creator, I want the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me, and I can build my audience.

3. As a developer, I want portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it, and abstract out the details for individual projects.

4. As a developer, I want my CSS organized (think SMACSS) so that I can find my stylings swiftly.

Day 3:

1. As the creator, I want the Home and About nav links to act as tabs, so my story is revealed FAST.

  This means your links to NOT navigate to a new page.
  Instead, your "single page app" shows only the section related to the navigation tab that is selected.
  You can use 'data-' attributes to associate a content section with a particular tab

2. Then use jQuery so when the tab is clicked, you hide all the sections, then reveal the associated section only.
As a reader, I want the portfolio to use a nice color scheme, so that it stands out visually.
